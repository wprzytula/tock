Platform-Specific Instructions: nRF52840-DK
===========================================

The [nRF52840 Development
Kit](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Software-and-Tools/Development-Kits/nRF52840-DK)
is a platform based around the nRF52840, an SoC with an ARM Cortex-M4 and a BLE
radio. The kit is Arduino shield compatible and includes several buttons.

## Getting Started

First, follow the [Tock Getting Started guide](../../../doc/Getting_Started.md)

JLinkExe is the preferred method to program the board. The development kit has
an integrated JTAG debugger, you simply need to [install the JLinkExe
software](../../../doc/Getting_Started.md#loading-the-kernel-onto-a-board).

## Programming the kernel
Once you have all software installed, you should be able to simply run
`make flash` in this directory to install a fresh kernel.

## Programming user-level applications
You can program an application over USB using `tockloader`:

```bash
$ cd libtock-c/examples/<app>
$ make
$ tockloader install
```

## Console output
To view the console output on the nrf52840dk:

```bash
$ tockloader listen
```

To view console output starting from the boot sequence **press the reset
button**.

This board supports two methods for writing messages to a console interface
(console driver for applications as well as debug statements in the kernel).

By default, messages are written to a UART interface over the GPIO pins `P0.05`
to `P0.08` (see the [main.rs](src/main.rs) file).

If you want a higher bandwidth communication channel, the nRF52840dk supports
the [Segger RTT protocol](rtt). This requires a micro USB cable attached to the
USB debugging port (the same used to flash Tock on the board), and is enabled by
setting the `USB_DEBUGGING` constant to `true` in the [main.rs](src/main.rs)
file. This disables the UART interface.

For instructions about how to receive RTT messages on the host, see the
[corresponding capsule](../../../capsules/src/segger_rtt.rs).

## Debugging

See the [nrf52dk README](../nrf52dk/README.md) for information about debugging
the nRF52840dk.
