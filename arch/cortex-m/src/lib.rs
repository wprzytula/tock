/// Trait to encapsulate differences in between Cortex-M variants
///
/// This trait contains functions and other associated data (constants) which
/// differs in between different Cortex-M architecture variants (e.g. Cortex-M0,
/// Cortex-M4, etc.). It is not designed to be implemented by an instantiable
/// type and passed around as a runtime-accessible object, but is to be used as
/// a well-defined collection of functions and data to be exposed to
/// architecture-dependent code paths. Hence, implementations can use an `enum`
/// without variants to implement this trait.
///
/// The fact that some functions are proper trait functions, while others are
/// exposed via associated constants is necessitated by the associated const
/// functions being `#\[naked\]`. To wrap these functions in proper trait
/// functions would require these trait functions to also be `#\[naked\]` to
/// avoid generating a function prologue and epilogue, and we'd have to call the
/// respective backing function from within an asm! block. The associated
/// constants allow us to simply reference any function in scope and export it
/// through the provided CortexMVariant trait infrastructure.
// This approach outlined above has some significant benefits over passing
// functions via symbols, as done before this change (tock/tock#3080):
//
// - By using a trait carrying proper first-level Rust functions, the type
//   signatures of the trait and implementing functions are properly
//   validated. Before these changes, some Cortex-M variants previously used
//   incorrect type signatures (e.g. `*mut u8` instead of `*const usize`) for
//   the user_stack argument. It also ensures that all functions are provided by
//   a respective sub-architecture at compile time, instead of throwing linker
//   errors.
//
// - Determining the respective functions at compile time, Rust might be able to
//   perform more aggressive inlining, especially if more device-specific proper
//   Rust functions (non hardware-exposed symbols, i.e. not fault or interrupt
//   handlers) were to be added.
//
// - Most importantly, this avoid ambiguity with respect to a compiler fence
//   being inserted by the compiler around calls to switch_to_user. The asm!
//   macro in that function call will cause Rust to emit a compiler fence given
//   the nomem option is not passed, but the opaque extern "C" function call
//   obscured that code path. While this is probably fine and Rust is obliged to
//   generate a compiler fence when switching to C code, having a traceable code
//   path for Rust to the asm! macro will remove any remaining ambiguity and
//   allow us to argue against requiring volatile accesses to userspace memory
//   (during context switches). See tock/tock#2582 for further discussion of
//   this issue.
